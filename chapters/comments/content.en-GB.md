# Comments and questions

First off, if you enjoyed this book, or you simply found it useful for something you were trying to get done, and you were wondering how to let me know you appreciated this book, you have two options: you can either head on over to the [Patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/bezierinfo) for this book, or if you prefer to make a one-time donation, head on over to the [buy Pomax a coffee](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?token=4OeU2bI9WLfex_fYcraxmooLUcJ_WDTn8AofsN1WYchMI7RB5Jq6CSZuAWNQTekJGyOh3G) page. This work has grown from a small primer to a 70-plus print-page-equivalent reader on the subject of BÃ©zier curves over the years, and a lot of coffee went into the making of it. I don't regret a minute I spent on writing it, but I can always do with some more coffee to keep on writing.

With that said, on to the comments!
